# DeepScale R2: A Cutting-Edge LLM-Powered Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Demo üéÆü§ñ

Welcome to **DeepScale R2**, the next evolution in our DeepScale AI series. This demo showcases an engaging, LLM-powered Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game where advanced language models provide strategic move suggestions and detailed chain-of-thought explanations. Built with the invaluable assistance of **Jarvis AI**‚Äîwhich contributed 95% of the coding‚Äîthis project highlights innovation, creativity, and the power of collaboration. Huge thanks to my personal assistant, Jarvis AI!

## Features üåü

- **LLM-Powered Move Suggestions**: Receive detailed, 200+ word chain-of-thought analyses and recommendations for optimal moves.
- **Interactive Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Gameplay**: Enjoy a modernized version of Tic Tac Toe with smooth animations and responsive controls.
- **Local Processing & Data Privacy**: All processing is done locally to ensure your data remains secure.
- **Customizable Difficulty**: Adjust the Algorithm's mistake probability to tailor the challenge to your skill level.
- **Animated UI with Tkinter**: Experience a dynamic interface complete with animated move placements.
- **GPU Acceleration Support**: The system can leverage GPU power‚Äîminimum recommended is an **RTX 30 series GPU**, though an **RTX 40 series GPU** is recommended for the best and smoothest experience.
- **Demo-Only Build**: This project is built solely for demo purposes. As such, it features a basic GUI and minimal UI/UX polish. The developer is not affiliated with professional UI/UX design.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Follow these steps to set up DeepScale R2 on your system:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adarsh3315/DeepScaleR2.git
   cd DeepScaleR2
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   - Create a virtual environment (e.g., named `myenv`):
     ```bash
     python -m venv myenv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - **Windows**: 
       ```bash
       myenv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - **macOS/Linux**: 
       ```bash
       source myenv/bin/activate
       ```

3. **Install Dependencies Manually**:
   > **Important:** You cannot install the libraries directly using the `requirements.txt` file. Instead, install each library manually using `pip`:
   - Install PyTorch with GPU support (if applicable):
     ```bash
     pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
     ```
   - Then install the remaining libraries one by one:
     ```bash
     pip install transformers
     pip install regex
     pip install bitsandbytes
     pip install "accelerate>=0.26.0"
     ```

4. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment (Optional)**:
   Once you're done, you can deactivate with:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

## Running the Application üöÄ

Start the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe demo by running the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

A new window will open displaying the game interface. Choose your side, and let the Algorithm (powered by advanced LLM analysis) challenge you in a strategic battle of wits!

## Usage Guide üìö

1. **Game Start**:
   - Launch the application and choose your symbol (X or O) to begin a new game.
   - The game automatically assigns the opponent as the Algorithm.

2. **During Gameplay**:
   - Click on the board to make your move.
   - The Algorithm will respond with its move after analyzing the board.
   - A detailed chain-of-thought explanation and move recommendation is generated by the LLM and displayed alongside the game board.

3. **Settings & Customization**:
   - Adjust the Algorithm's mistake probability via the Settings menu to tweak the game difficulty.
   - Note: The UI is intentionally simple as this demo is focused on showcasing LLM-powered analysis rather than advanced GUI features.

> **Demo-Only Notice:**  
> This project is created strictly for demonstration purposes. As such, the GUI is basic and the developer is not involved with professional UI/UX design.

## Advanced Configuration üõ†Ô∏è

- **GPU Acceleration**:  
  If your system has an **RTX 30 series GPU (minimum)**, you can benefit from GPU acceleration. For the smoothest and most responsive experience, an **RTX 40 series GPU** is recommended.

- **Model Customization**:  
  Adjust parameters like temperature, response length, and top-k sampling to fine-tune the LLM‚Äôs behavior during gameplay analysis.

## Troubleshooting üõë

- **Model Initialization Issues**:  
  Ensure you have sufficient system memory and that all dependencies have been installed manually as instructed.

- **Performance Concerns**:  
  If the application is running slowly, verify that your GPU is properly recognized and consider upgrading to an RTX 40 series GPU for optimal performance.

- **UI Limitations**:  
  Remember, this demo features a basic GUI by design. The focus is on showcasing LLM-powered strategic analysis rather than advanced UI/UX design.
